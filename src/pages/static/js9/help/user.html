<h3>Introduction to JS9</h3>
<p>
JS9 is a JavaScript version of the de facto standard DS9 image display
program. It allows you to view and manipulate astronomical image data
in your browser.

<h3>Getting Started with JS9</h3>
<p>
JS9 provides astronomical image display capabilities right in your browser. 
JS9 takes both its name and its core functionality from the de facto standard
DS9 image display program for desktop use, which is available at:
<pre>
    http://ds9.si.edu
</pre>
The JS9 display consists of one or more components that can be added
to a web page by the web page designer.  At a minimum, the JS9 display
will contain an image display canvas. It usually also will display a
menu strip containing several pull-down menus. Traditionally, this
menu strip is placed on top of the image canvas, but web designers
have complete control over its placement. JS9 also can display an info
box, a command-line window, a pan window, a zoom window, as well as
other plugins. All of these windows can be brought up dynamically from
the View menu.

<p>
Astronomical image data usually is offered on a JS9 web page as one or more
clickable URLs. When you click on a data URL, it is displayed on the JS9 image
canvas. Multiple images can be loaded into a single JS9 display. The <b>File</b>
menu allows you to switch between these images.

<p>
Once an image is loaded, you can move the mouse (or a single finger on
a touch screen) to display position and pixel value information.
Pressing the left mouse button and moving the mouse (or using two
fingers on a touch screen) will change the contrast/bias of the
displayed image, bringing image features into relief.

<p>
These mouse/touch actions are configurable, both by web page
developers and by users. See
the <a href="../plugins/help/mousetouch.html">Mouse Touch plugin</a> for
more information.

<p>
Menu options allow you to change the scaling algorithm and/or color
map, add geometric regions of interest, change world coordinate system
(WCS) parameters, and run site-specific astronomical analysis tasks on
the original FITS data.

<p>
<a name="menus"></a> 
<h3>JS9 Menus</h3>
<p>
The following menus are in the default JS9 menu bar. Of course, web
designers have control over which menus are displayed (or even whether
the menu bar itself is displayed). Thus, not all of the menus listed below
will be found on all JS9-enabled web pages.

<p>
Note that the default menubar has a style in which all of the
major menus are shown at the top-level of the menubar. This is
the <b>classic</b> style. JS9 also supports a <b>mac</b> style
menubar, in which the <b>File</b>, <b>Edit</b> and <b>View</b> menus
are placed on the left side of the menubar and the <b>Help</b> menu on the
right. The other main menus are displayed as sub-menus within
the <b>View</b> menu.

<p>
The default top-level JS9 menus are:
<ul>
<li><p><b>File:</b> The File menu displays a list of all images
currently loaded into this instance of JS9. The displayed image is
marked with a star burst.  To display a different image, simply choose
it in the menu.  The menu contains an <b>open ...</b> options which
displays a file browser for loading FITS files (compressed or
uncompressed).  It also contains options to:
<ul>
<li><b>open local file ...</b> bring up a file browser dialog box to choose a FITS,PNG, or JPEG file for display
<li><b>accessing data archives ...</b>a help page containing links to archives that are known to work with JS9
<li><b>open link via proxy ...</b> enter a link to a FITS, PNG, or JPG file that will be downloaded onto the web-page server host and displayed (if configured)
<li><b>open link via CORS ...</b> enter a shared Dropbox link to display a FITS file
<li><b>extract image section ...</b> if this image has a parent file, you can extract a section from that parent for display (if configured)
<li><b>print ...</b> print the current image display window (including 2D graphics)
<li><b>display FITS header</b> display FITS header of the current image
<li><b>display FITS HDUs</b> display a list of HDUs in a multi-extension FITS file
<li><b>save this image ...</b> save the current image data in one of these formats:
<ul>
<li><b>FITS</b> (standard astronomical image file, without 2D graphics)
<li><b>JPEG</b> (also includes 2D graphics, such as regions)
<li><b>PNG</b>  (also includes 2D graphics, such as regions)
</ul>
<li><b>move this image to ...</b> to move the current image to a new display
(either an existing display or a new light window)
<li><b>sync images ...</b> synchronize two or more images, so that when an operation (change of colormap, contrast/bias, pan, regions, scale, wcs, zoom)
is performed on one image, it also is performed on the other(s)
<li><b>unsync images ...</b> unsynchronize previously sync'ed images
<li><b>separate these images</b> move each image in this display to a new display
<li><b>gather all images here</b> move all images from other displays to this display
<li><b>refresh this image</b> an advanced option that will call the
internal redisplay routine for the displayed image (useful, for
example, if you are reprocessing the image on disk and want to view
the new data)
<li><b>display the full image</b> an advanced option that tries to
load and display the entire image (might cause the page to crash if
the image is too large)
<li><b>display selected cutouts</b> selected region(s) are used to define the center and size of new image section(s); note that image sections are always rectangles and region angles are ignored
<li><b>free image memory</b> free up memory used to store the FITS file internally (which is needed for WCS reprojections, viewing FITS extensions and data cubes)
<li><b>close this image</b> to clear the current image and release browser resources
<li><b>close all images</b> to clear all images and release browser resources
<li><b>remove proxy file</b> to clear a server proxy file and release browser resources
<li><b>load catalog ...</b> load a tab-delimited catalog file into the display
<li><b>save active catalog</b> save the currently active catalog (Shape Layers plugin has more general support)
<li><b>load session ...</b> load a previously saved session into the display
<li><b>save session ...</b> save information about the current image or all images loaded into this display: filename, scaling, colormap, contrast/bias, zoom, regions, catalogs, etc. are stored in a json file
<li><b>create mosaic ...</b> create a mosaic image from the current image or all images in this display
<li><b>new JS9 light window</b> create a light window containing a JS9 instance
<li><b>new JS9 separate window</b> create a separate window containing a JS9 instance
<li><b>connect to JS9 helper (Electron-based apps only)</b> if a
Node.js-based helper is not running, an Electron-based JS9 app will
run the helper internally at start-up. Subsequent Electron-based apps
will use the first app's helper. If the first app is terminated, other
apps no longer have access to that helper.  Within five minutes of the
termination, use this option to start the helper in one remaining
app and other apps will reconnect.
<li><b>display pageID</b>, a unique ID for this page that can be used to communicate externally with a JS9 instance when multiple JS9 instances are running (js9 --pageid [pageid])
</ul>

<li><p><b>Edit:</b> allows you to copy and paste regions, positions,
and pixel values to/from the clipboard:
<ul>
<li><b>edit selected</b> display selected region's configuration window
<li><b>copy selected</b> copy the selected region to the system
clipboard, so that you can transfer it to other JS9 displays or to
programs outside of JS9
<li><b>copy all</b> copy all regions to the system clipboard,
so that you can transfer them to other JS9 displays or programs
outside of JS9
<li><b>paste to region pos</b> paste previously copied region(s),
usually to another JS9 display. For security reasons, web pages are
not permitted to read the system clipboard, so the paste command reads
an internal variable filled from the previous JS9 copy. Thus, you
cannot paste data copied from outside JS9. Some day ...
<li><b>paste to current pos</b> paste previously copied region(s) to
the current mouse (or arrow key) position in a JS9 display. Usually
you would use the keyboard shortcut (currently capital 'P') for this
sort of pasting, but you also can use the meta key to freeze the mouse
position and then use this menu option
<li><b>undo remove</b> restore the last removed region (or set of removed regions, if more than one was removed in a single operation)
<li><b>copy wcs pos</b> copy the current WCS position to the system clipboard
<li><b>copy value/pos</b> copy the current pixel value and WCS position to the system clipboard
</ul>

<li><p><b>View:</b> displays a list of plugin menu options, including the following core options:
<ul>
<li> The <b>Console</b> menu option will bring up a movable, light-weight
console window into which JS9 commands can be entered.
<li> The <b>Extension</b> menu option allows you to display images from a FITS
multi-extension file.
<li> The <b>Data Cube</b> menu option allows you to display slices of a 3D FITS
data cube.
<li> The <b>InfoBox</b> menu option allows you to display value and position
information in a separate light-weight window.
<li> The <b>Magnifier</b> menu option will bring up a movable,
light-weight window showing a blocked image of the data in an area
surrounding the mouse as it moves. The default magnification of four
can be changed using command buttons on the magnifier window.
<li> The <b>Mouse/Touch</b> menu option allows you to change the
actions performed when you move the mouse over an image with zero,
one, or two buttons pressed.  It also configures touch actions using
one, two, or three fingers.
<li> The <b>Panner</b> menu option will bring up a movable,
light-weight panner window that displays the full image along with a
viewport rectangle showing the currently displayed image section in
the primary image window. The viewport can be moved around in order to pan
to different locations in the primary image. The panner also has
command button options to zoom the viewport itself. (This makes
the viewport rectangle larger at the expense of displaying only a
section of the full image. It is useful for panning in a very large
image.) 
</ul>
<p>
In addition to these core options, the <b>View</b> menu also lists the
currently-loaded <b>View plugins</b>. JS9 itself supplies the following plugins:
<ul>
<li>The <b>Archive and Catalogs</b> menu option allows you to display image data retrieved from various archives and overlay catalog information.
<li>The <b>Binning</b> menu option supports binning and column filtering on FITS binary tables.
<li>The <b>Pixel Table</b> menu option displays an array of pixel values around the current mouse position.
</ul>
<p>
Web developers can develop and register other plugins (which generally are
loaded into either the <b>View</b> or <b>Analysis</b> menus).
<p>
The <b>display value/position</b> option specifies whether
image position and image pixel value is displayed as the mouse (or
finger) moves over the image. By default, this information is
displayed in the upper left of the image. You can redirect the display
to a movable, light-weight window by choosing the <b>InfoBox</b> menu
option.
<p>
The <b>display crosshair for this image</b> option will display a
crosshair at the mouse position when the Shift key is held down
(without the Shift key on iOS devices). It is turned off by default.

<p>
The <b>match wcs with other crosshairs</b> option will display a crosshair in
other JS9 displays, matching the WCS position of the mouse in this display
(assuming the other image has its own crosshair enabled).
<p>
The <b>display toolbar tooltips</b> option specifies whether tooltips
are displayed as the mouse hovers over an icon in the <b>Toolbar</b>
plugin. (For mobile devices, a single tap will display the tooltip,
requiring a second tap to execute the toolbar action.)
<p>
The <b>new image inherits current params</b> option specifies whether
a new image grabs the image params (e.g., colormap, scale, zoom, etc.)
from the currently displayed image. If false, these params are taken
from the default JS9.imageOpts object.
<p>
Finally, the <b>change width/height</b> menu option allows you to
specify a new width and height for the JS9 display.

<li><p><b>Zoom:</b> The <b>zoomIn</b> and <b>zoomOut</b> menu options
zoom the primary image in or out by a factor of
two. The <b>zoomToFit</b> options calculates a zoom factor that fits
the entire image into the JS9 display.  You also can set the zoom
factor to a pre-specified value using menu options.  You can specify
any floating point zoom factor in the <b>numeric zoom value</b> text
box. The <b>pan to center</b> option pans to the center of the image, while
the <b>reset zoom/pan</b> sets the zoom to 1 and centers the display.

<li><p><b>Scale:</b> Each scale option specifies a different scaling
algorithm to use when converting image pixel values to RGB
values. (The procedure for doing this conversion is detailed in the
DS9 documentation titled <a href="http://ds9.si.edu/doc/ref/how.html"
target="_blank">"How It Works"</a>.) The log scale, for example, is
especially useful with X-ray data. Histogram equalization (histeq)
tries to maximize contrast across the range of data values and is
useful in a wide variety of cases. The current scale is marked with a
star burst.

<p>
You also can change the low and high values used to clip the image
data before scaling by changing the <b>low clipping value</b>
and/or <b>high clipping value</b> numbers. These values are set
initially with the data's min and max values or the z1,z2 values
calculated by the <b>IRAF zscale</b> algorithm (depending on the value
of the web site's <b>JS9.imageOpts.scaleclipping</b> parameter. The
default usually is "dataminmax".). Finally, you can use the
<b>Clipping Limits</b> plugin to set the clipping values
to data min/max, zscale z1/z2 or zscale z1/max, or set the clipping
values using the pixel distribution plot.

<li><p><b>Colormap:</b> Each colormap option specifies a different
distribution of RGB values to use when converting image pixel values to RGB.
(The procedure for doing this conversion is detailed in the
DS9 documentation titled "How It Works".) Choose the colormap you like best,
or try different ones to see how data features can be brought to the fore
by color and contrast/bias.

<p>
The <b>image filters</b> menu option provides a number of well-known
image processing functions that act directly on the displayed RGB
image data (not the underlying raw astronomical data, as with the
<b>Gaussian blur</b> in the <b>Analysis</b> menu).  Thus, when you can
run one of these routines on an image, its effect will be undone if
you redraw the image by changing the contrast/bias, colormap,
etc. Also, since these functions act on the current RGB image, their
effect is cumulative.  See the <b>JS9.FilterRGBImage()</b> section in
the <a href="publicapi.html">JS9 Public API</a> for more information about
the individual functions.

<p>
You can enter a floating point value into the <b>contrast value</b> and 
<b>bias value</b> text boxes to set the contrast/bias. Note that the
contrast value ranges from 0 to 10 and the bias ranges from 0 to 1
(following DS9 conventions).

<p>
The <b>reset contrast/bias</b> option restores the original
contrast/bias value (which is especially useful if you changed the
contrast/bias or scale and now can't see any features at all!)

<p>
The <b>load colormap</b> option brings up a File menu from which you
can choose a user-defined colormap to load.

<p>
The <b>save colormap</b> option saves the active colormap definition
for the currently displayed image to a file (useful for editing to
make a new colormap).

<p>
The <b>invert colormap</b> option inverts the colormap (e.g. in the gray map,
this will change white to black and vice versa). 

<p>
If you have three images of the same size, scale, and pointing
direction (e.g. three energy cuts of a Chandra data set), you can
display each one separately and assign to them one of the <b>red,
green, or blue</b> colormaps. If you then select the <b>RGB mode</b>
menu option, they will be displayed as one RGB composite image. The
current image (as shown in the <b>File</b> menu) determines which of
the three independent colormaps is changed by the contrast/bias
manipulation. To remove an image from the RGB composite, give it a
different colormap. Re-join (or add a new image) by assigning one of
the RGB colormaps. Simply turn off RGB mode to display the images
separately.

<li><p><b>Region:</b> Astronomical regions format is described
<a href="https://js9.si.edu/regions/regions.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
Choose the appropriate menu option to create a
region of type <b>annulus</b>, <b>box</b>, <b>circle</b>, <b>ellipse</b>,
<b>line</b>, <b>point</b>, <b>polygon</b>, <b>text</b>.
(see below for details on how to use regions). One or more regions can
be created and manipulated on a single image.

<p>
The <b>load</b> menu option will load a file of regions and
display them on the current image. Regions can be specified using the
a dialect of the widely-used DS9/Funtools regions format, as described 
<a href="regions.html">here</a>.

<p>
The <b>list</b> menu option will display all regions.

<p>
The <b>save ...</b> save all regions in one of these formats:
<ul>
<li><b>regions</b> text file in astronomical regions format.
<li><b>SVG</b> text file in SVG/XML format (useful for importing into
programs such as Photoshop for further processing).
</ul>
NB: The file will be saved in the folder where your other browser
downloads are stored.

<p>
The <b>copy to ...</b> menu option will copy regions from the
current image to a specified image (or to all images). If one or more
regions are actively selected in the current image, they alone will be
copied. Otherwise, all regions will be copied.

<p>
The <b>remove</b> menu option will delete all regions.

<p>
The <b>selected regions ...</b> submenu contains options that apply to
the selected region(s), including the ability to edit, list, save,
remove, or copy the selected region(s).  The submenu also allows you
to change the following properties of selected regions by entering text values:
<ul>
<li><b>color</b>: the color of the region, using either a name
("wheat") or #rrggbb syntax ("#f5deb3").
<li><b>width</b>: the numeric width of a region
<li><b>dash</b>: two comma or space-delimited numeric values specifying the
numeric width of a filled segment, followed by the width of a blank segment
<li><b>tags</b>: replacement tags for this region
</ul>
<p>
The selected regions submenu also supports the ability to toggle the
"source"/"background" or "include"/"exclude" tags (which is heavily
used in X-ray astronomy).

<p>
The <b>list on change</b> menu option will cause all regions to be
listed whenever one changes.

<li><p><b>WCS:</b> Use this menu option to select a world coordinate
system when displaying pixel positions and regions (assuming
the data file supports WCS). Available systems are: <b>FK4</b>, <b>FK5</b>,
<b>ICRS</b>, <b>galactic</b>, or <b>ecliptic</b>. The <b>native</b>
option chooses the system stored in the data file. The <b>image</b>
and <b>physical</b> systems will display only image coordinates (not
WCS coordinates). <b>Physical</b> coordinates are tied to the original
(block 1) file coordinates while <b>image</b> coordinates are tied to
the current image data being displayed. Server-side X-ray analysis
routines operating on the original file generally want physical coords
rather than image coords. Browser-based plugin routines generally use
image coordinates to operate on the in-memory image data.

<p>
You also can choose the units in which WCS information is displayed:
<b>degrees</b>, <b>radians</b>, or <b>sexagesimal</b>. Image and
physical coordinates are displayed in units of pixels.

<p>
The <b>alternate wcs</b> menu option allows you to choose an alternate
world coordinate system, if one or more are defined in the current
FITS file.  The submenu lists the WCS version (i.e. the letter "A" -
"Z", or "default") and, if present, the WCSNAME header parameter
associated with this WCS.

<p>
The <b>reproject</b> menu option allows you to reproject the
image using the WCS associated with another displayed image. The
reprojected data is placed in a new <b>raw data layer</b> called
"reproject". You can switch between layers using the <b>View->raw data
layers</b> option. If the <b>display wcs-aligned</b> option is set,
the reprojected image will be aligned with the wcs reference image. If
you change the pan/zoom of the latter, the former will be re-aligned.
(The converse is not true: changing the reprojected image does not
change the wcs reference image.)

<li><p><b>Analysis:</b>
JS9 supports both client-side analysis (i.e.,
analysis in the browser) and server-side analysis (where requests are
made to a back-end server, and returned results are displayed in the
browser).

<p>
Client-side analysis tasks can be written using the JS9
<a href="localtasks.html">Plugin</a> capability, and
the <b>Analysis</b> menu lists the currently loaded <b>Analysis
Plugins</b>. For example, JS9 supplies the
<b>Imexam</b> plugin, which offers the following tasks:
<ul>
<li> 3dPlot
<li> Encircled Energy
<li> Histogram
<li> Radial Proj
<li> Region Stats
<li> X Proj
<li> Y Proj
</ul>

<p>
JS9 supplies a few other client-side analysis tasks:
<ul>
<li><b>Coordinate Grid:</b> display a WCS-based coordinate grid. The
coordinate grid parameters can be changed using the <b>Preferences</b>
plugin in the <b>View</b> menu.
<li><b>Counts in Regions:</b> Run the
<a href="https://js9.si.edu/regions/regcnts.html" target="_blank">regcnts</a>
program (compiled into the browser using
<a href="https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/" target="_blank">
Emscripten</a>) on the specified
source and background regions and return a text display.  This is the
same task as the server-side task, but running on the internal FITS file.
<li><b>Radial Profile:</b> Run the
<a href="https://js9.si.edu/regions/regcnts.html" target="_blank">regcnts</a>
program (compiled into the browser using
<a href="https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/" target="_blank">
Emscripten</a>) on the specified
source and background regions and return a plot display. The source
regions consist of circles.  This is the same task as the server-side
task, but running on the internal FITS file.
<li><b>3D Counts in Regions:</b> Run the
<a href="https://js9.si.edu/regions/regcnts.html" target="_blank">regcnts</a>
program (compiled into the browser using
<a href="https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/" target="_blank">
Emscripten</a>) on the specified
source and background regions for each slice in a 3D data cube and return a
text display.
<li><b>3D Plot using Regions :</b> Run the
<a href="https://js9.si.edu/regions/regcnts.html" target="_blank">regcnts</a>
program (compiled into the browser using
<a href="https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/" target="_blank">
Emscripten</a>) on the specified source and background regions for
each slice in a 3D data cube and plot the background-subtracted results.
<li><b>Gaussian Blur:</b> enter a sigma (radius) to create a new raw
data layer called "gaussBlur", in which the image pixel values are
blurred using a Gaussian function with the specified sigma. The
routine uses the fast Gaussian blur algorithm (approximating a full
Gaussian blur with three passes of a box blur) described <a href="
http://blog.ivank.net/fastest-gaussian-blur.html" target="_blank">
here</a>.
</ul>

<p>
In addition, each JS9 site can define server-side analysis
tasks to be run from the Analysis menu. Server-side tasks are of two types:
<ul>
<li><b>immediate tasks:</b> These tasks are executed directly and
immediately from the Analysis menu. No parameter setup is needed.
<li><b>parameter tasks:</b> These tasks bring up a lightweight
parameter window allowing various parameters to be set before
executing the task. Parameter tasks are identified by the presence of
an ellipsis (...) after the task name.
</ul>
<p>
For example, the JS9 web page at
<href="https://js9.si.edu" target="_blank">https://js9.si.edu</a>
offers the following tasks:
<ul>
<li><b>FITS Header(s):</b> Display all FITS headers for this FITS file.
<li><b>Counts in Regions:</b> Run the
<a href="https://js9.si.edu/regions/regcnts.html" target="_blank">regcnts</a>
program on the specified
source and background regions and return a text display (immediate task).
<li><b>Radial Profile:</b> Run the
<a href="https://js9.si.edu/regions/regcnts.html" target="_blank">regcnts</a>
program on the specified
source and background regions and return a plot display. The source regions
consist of circles or annuli (immediate task).
<li><b>Energy Plot:</b> Create a histogram of the pi column (or energy
column for Chandra data) of a binary table and return a plot display
(immediate task). The column must exist in the data file (e.g.,
Chandra ACIS data but not Chandra HRC data).
<li><b>Light Curve:</b>Create a histogram of the time column of a binary table
and return a plot display (immediate task). The time column
must exist in the data file.
<li><b>Histogram Plot:</b> Create a histogram of the user-specified
column of a binary table and return a plot display (parameter
task). Parameters include: histogram column name, number of bins, use
bin width instead of bin size, and an option to normalize by bin
width. A help file is appended to the parameter display.
<li><b>Event Filter:</b> filter the events of a binary table and return
an image representation of the filtered events. Note that when a FITS file
is loaded directly into JS9, you can use the <b>Binning/Filtering</b> plugin
to filter events instead.
</ul>
<p>
If you drag and drop a FITS file onto a JS9 web page connected to a
remove server (such as <href="https://js9.si.edu" target="_blank">
https://js9.si.edu</a>),
the FITS file will, of course, not be accessible on the server (it's only
stored in the browser). As a result, no server-side analysis tasks will
be available. But if the remote server supports <b>proxy loading</b>
of FITS data, the Analysis menu will display an option to <b>upload FITS to
make tasks available</b>. Select this option and your FITS file will
be sent to the server so that server-side analysis can be performed.

<p>
The <b>set data analysis path ...</b> option allows you to specify a
colon-separated list of directories for JS9 to search when looking for
FITS data files that have been dropped onto the display. This is used
by JS9 when performing server-side data analysis on local
drag-and-drop FITS files. It is necessary to specify data paths
explicitly since web pages are not allowed to determine the pathname
of such files automatically (for obvious security reasons).

<p>
For local servers, the <b>set this image file's path</b> option allows
you to specify the path (absolute or relative to the displayed web
page) of an image file loaded via <i>Drag and Drop</i> or <i>Open
Local File</i>.  For security reasons, browsers do not expose the path
of files loaded in these two ways. However, for a local web page, you can
safely specify the image path in order to refresh the image or run
server-based analysis.

<li><p><b>Help:</b> Show this and other JS9 help pages. The <b>Help</b> menu
also contains help for <b>Plugins</b>, including the <b>Imexam</b> plugins
listed above.
</ul>

<p>
<a name="mouse"></a> 
<h3>JS9 Mouse Interaction</h3>
<p>
In keeping with the needs of mobile devices, JS9 utilizes a single
mouse button for user interaction. Keyboard input also is minimized.
Moving the mouse (or a single finger on a tablet) over the image will
display the position/value of individual pixels.  Pressing and moving
the mouse (or two fingers) will change the contrast and bias of the
image. A double-click (or double-tap) inside a region will bring up
the configuration menu for that region.

<p>
<a name="regions"></a> 
<h3>JS9 Regions</h3>
<p>
Regions are geometric shapes that can be used to mark part of an image
for analysis. JS9 allows you to create the following region
types: <b>annulus, box, circle, ellipse, line, point, polygon</b>.
A <b>text</b> region also can be created to annotate an image.  When one
of these options is selected, the region is created in the center of
the image. It then can be dragged to the desired location. Arrow keys
also will move the region one screen pixel in the specified direction.
A selected region can be deleted by pressing the <b>Delete</b> key (where
available. On a tablet, use the delete option in the configuration menu).

<p>
Click inside a region to select it and display the resize/rotate
controls around its perimeter. Grabbing a handle allows the size of
the region to be adjusted or rotated. In the case of the box and
ellipse regions, the width and height are controlled separately. Click
outside the region to de-select (or click another region to select
that one).

<p>
For a line region, the end-points serve as both resize controls (arrow
icon) and stretch points (hand icon). You might have to move the mouse
around a bit to switch from one to another. The control action is to
resize the region in both directions (i.e., the same as other regions).
The stretch action allows you to move this end-point while the other one
remains fixed.

<p>
A double-click inside a region brings up a configuration menu. You can
change various values associated with a region by entering new values
in the appropriate text boxes and the clicking <b>Apply</b>.

<p>
The configuration menu has the following standard options:
<ul>
<li><b>id:</b> the id of this region, which can be used programmatically to select it for processing (read-only)
<li><b>type:</b> the type of region (read-only)
<li><b>image center:</b> new image pixel values can be entered to change the region position
<li><b>WCS center:</b> new WCS position values can be entered to change the region position (where WCS is available)
<li><b>Text:</b> create a child text region with the specified text
<li><b>Color:</b> change the color of the region (color name or #RRGGBB syntax)
<li><b>Tags:</b> the default tags (<b>source, background, include, exclude</b>)
are used in X-ray astronomy but you can enter any string to tag this region and then select programmatically using tags
<li><b>WCS Region:</b> the WCS representation of this region, where applicable (read-only)
<li><b>Image Region:</b> the image representation of this region, where applicable (read-only)
<li><b>Misc Properties:</b>use JSON format to specify shape properties not listed above (e.g. {"transparentCorners": true}, see <a href="http://fabricjs.com/docs/fabric.Object.html" target="_blank">Fabric.js</a> for more info on shape properties.)
<li><b>Options:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Changeable:</b> enable/disable move and resize capability
<li><b>List On Change:</b> list this region when it's moved or resized
<li><b>Remove:</b> remove this region. On an iPad, this currently is
the only way to delete a region.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
In addition, regions of different type support specific configuration
parameters in this menu.
<br>
The <b>annulus</b> region supports:
<ul>
<li><b>Radii:</b> change the radii of the region (in pixels)
</ul>
The <b>box</b> region supports:
<ul>
<li><b>Width:</b> change the width of the region (in pixels)
<li><b>Height:</b> change the height of the region (in pixels)
<li><b>Angle:</b> change the angle of the region (in degrees, counter-clockwise)
</ul>
The <b>circle</b> region supports:
<ul>
<li><b>Radius:</b> change the radius of the region (in pixels)
</ul>
The <b>ellipse</b> region supports:
<ul>
<li><b>Radii:</b> change the r1 and r2 radii of the region (in pixels)
<li><b>Angle:</b> change the angle of the region (in degrees, counter-clockwise)
</ul>
The <b>polygon</b> and line regions support:
<ul>
<li><b>Points:</b> change the image points of the region (in pixels)
<li><b>Angle:</b> change the angle of the region (in degrees, counter-clockwise)
</ul>
The <b>text</b> region supports:
<ul>
<li><b>Text:</b> change the text of the region
<li><b>Angle:</b> change the angle of the region (in degrees, counter-clockwise)
</ul>

<h3>Meta Key Accelerator</h3>
<p>
The <b>meta</b> key is the <b>Command</b> key on a Mac and the <b>Control</b>
key everywhere else.

<p>
When a keyboard is available, pressing the <b>meta</b> key while
clicking in the primary image window will pan the image so that the
clicked location is in the center of the display. 

<p>
The <b>meta</b> key also disables execution of plugin callbacks on
all mouse events. See <a href="localtasks.html">Local Tasks</a> for
more information about plugins and browser-based analysis.

<p>
Within a polygon or a line, if you press <b>meta</b> and click the
mouse on the polygon or line border, a new point will be added at that
point. If you press the <b>meta</b> key and click on an existing
point, it will be deleted.

<p>
<a name="dragdrop"></a> 
<h3>Drag and Drop Images</h3>
<p>
You can drag and drop FITS images and binary tables, PNG images, and
JPEG images onto JS9 to display the image data. All browser-based
functions (scaling, colormap, pan, zoom, regions, WCS) should work as
expected. You can execute server-side analysis tasks on the FITS files
if the back-end server is running on your local host machine. In this
case, you probably will need to set your DataPath variable in the
Analysis menu to help JS9 locate the original data file.

<p>
<a name="resize"></a> 
<h3>Resizing the JS9 Display</h3>
<p>
The JS9 Display can be resized using the the <b>View:change
width/height</b>menu option (or the JS9.ResizeDisplay() JavaScript
routine).  The View menu's resize parameter can be two values (width
and height) or a single value representing both.  In addition, if an
image containing wcs info is being displayed, you can append a single
quote to specify a size in arc minutes (e.g. 5') or a double quote to
specify a size in arc seconds (e.g. 300&#34;).
<p>
The <b>View: set to image size</b> option will set the display size to
the size of the current image. The <b>View: set size to full
window</b> option will resize the JS9 display to the size of the
browser window's window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight properties,
and will scroll the display to the center of the window.  (Note that
the rest of the web page is still available via scrolling, including
the menubar.)  The <b>View: reset to original size</b> option will set
the display size back to the original size.  Display resize can be
turned off by setting the JS9.globalOpts.resize variable
to <b>false</b> in the js9Prefs.json file.
<p>
Also by default, the JS9 Display can be resized using a grab handle in
the lower right-hand corner of the display.  This feature can be
turned off setting the JS9.globalOpts.resizeHandle variable
to <b>false</b> in the js9Prefs.json file.
<p>
See <a href="knownissues.html">Known Issues</a>
for a discussion of limitations imposed on resize by Webkit
browsers such as Chrome and Safari.
