The JS9 Public API is meant to be stable and well-documented. If we are
forced to make an incompatible change to the API, it will be documented
here (as well as in help/publicapi.html).

20141028: callback function to RunAnalysis and SubmitAnalysis

Due to an oversight, the signature of the callback function supplied to
RunAnalysis (and its derivative function, SubmitAnalysis) was missing the
errcode argument. To correct this mistake, the signature was changed from:
    func(stdout, stderr, aobj)
to:
    func(stdout, stderr, errcode, aobj)
See js9onchange.html for an example of using this callbback function.
