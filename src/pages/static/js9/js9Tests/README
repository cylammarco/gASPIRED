Selenium-based tests for JS9. To run:

    cd  to top level JS9 directory
    node js9Test.js --all
or
    node js9Test.js [switches] test1.js test2.js ...

See js9Test.js for switches, or contact saord@cfa.harvard.edu.
		  
NB: This test setup requires installation of selenium-webdriver for Node.js.
We don't supply this by default because it's very large (20Mb). To install:

       npm install selenium-webdriver

See https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver for details.
