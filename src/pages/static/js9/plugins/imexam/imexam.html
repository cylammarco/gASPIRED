<h3>Region Statistics </h3>

A rectangular box of image pixels is selected and some statistical values 
are computed from the data.  The selected box may be rotated for box and 
ellipse regions.

<p>
<b>N.B.:</b> Currently the region shape is ignored and the values reflect a rectangular section of image pixels.

<blockquote>
    <h4>Notes</h4>

    <ul>
     <li><b>Totcounts and bscounts</b>
     <p>
            Totcounts are the total counts in the box region, while bscounts
	    has the calculated background (see below) subtracted from the total.

     <li><b>Background and Noise</b>
     <p>
	    The background and noise are obtained from the outer 4 pixel-wide
	    perimeter of the selected region.  The background value is the median 
	    value of this area and the noise value is the RMS.
     </li>
     <li><b>Centroid</b>
     <p>
	    The centroid is obtained by locating the brightest 9 pixel box and 
	    computing the centroid of the background subtracted data about this point.
     </li>
     <li><b>FWHM</b>
     <p>
	    The FWHM is estimated from the image moments about the centroid, assuming 
	    a Gaussian distribution.
     </li>

<h3>X and Y Projection Plot</h3>

A rectangular box of image pixels is selected and the projection along the
region's X or Y axis is plotted.  The sum, average or median of the projected
pixels may be selected.  The selected box may be rotated for box and ellipse
regions.

<h3>Radial Profile</h3>

A rectangular box of image pixels is selected and the pixels values are
plotted against their respective radii.  A Gaussian is fit to the radial profile
data and the result is also plotted.  The fitted results of the 4 parameter fit
are displayed with the plot.  The selected box may be rotated for box and 
ellipse regions.

<p>
The center pixel from which the radii are computed is determined from the
background subtracted centroid taken about the brightest 9 pixels in the data
(same centroid as is displayed in the region stats plugin).

<h3>Pixel Value Histogram</h3>

A rectangular box of image pixels is selected and a histogram of the values
is plotted.  The selected box may be rotated for box and 
ellipse regions.

The selected pixels are binned into 250 bins between the minimum and maximum value
found in the selected region.

<h3>Encircled Energy</h3>

A rectangular box of image pixels is selected and background subtracted.  The 
analysis radius is determined from the region as follows:

    <ul>
     <li><b>circle</b>: region radius</li>
     <li><b>annulus</b>: max annulus radius</li>
     <li><b>box</b>: half the average height an width</li>
     <li><b>ellipse</b>: average axis radius</li>
     <li><b>polygon</b>: half the average of the height and width of polygon bounding box</li>
    </ul>

The values within the analysis radius are binned in 1 pixel radial bins.  The
bins are normalized by the sum of all pixels and the result is plotted.

<p>
The background is obtained as the median from the outer 4 pixel wide perimeter of the
selected region.

<p>
The center pixel from which the encircled energy is computed is determined from
the background subtracted centroid taken about the brightest 9 pixels in the
data (same centroid as is displayed in the region stats plugin).

<p>
The 50 and 80 percent encircled energy points are displayed over the plot.

<h3>3d Surface Plot</h3>

A rectangular box of image pixels is selected and plotted as a surface.
The selected box may be rotated for box and ellipse regions.
