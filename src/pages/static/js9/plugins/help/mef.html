<h3>JS9 Multi-Extension FITS Files</h3>

<p>
The <b>Extensions</b> plugin allows you to display the HDU extensions
in a multi-extension FITS file. Simply click on the desired extension
to display it.

<p>
By default, the display (including the underlying raw data) of the new
extension replaces the previous data in the same image. If, however,
the <b>Display each extension as a separate image</b> checkbox is
selected, each succeeding extension will be displayed as a separate
image, so that you can view two or more extensions simultaneously. In
this case, you can use the <b>Blink</b> extension to blink the
extensions or the <b>File->move image to</b> menu option to move an
extension to a existing display or new light window. In all cases, the
raw data for that extension is available for browser-based analysis.

<p>
Note that some extensions are not available for display, including images
of less than two dimensions, and binary tables not containing x and y columns.
These extensions are marked as invalid by a strike through their description.
