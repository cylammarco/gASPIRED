<h3>JS9 FITS Data Cubes</h3>

<p>
The <b>Data Cube</b> plugin allows you to display slices from a FITS
3D data cube. You can choose the particular slice to display using the
slider, text box, or navigation buttons. You also can blink the slices
in order using the blink and stop buttons. The default blink interval
is one second, but this can be changed with the rate menu.

<p>
By default, the slice axis is the third axis of the cube. Use the menu
at the right to specify a different slice axis.

<p>
You also can load each slice separately into JS9 with the <b>Load All</b>
button. Each slice will be identified by the original filename with a
<b>&lt;n&gt;</b> suffix, where n is the slice number. Loading all slices
separately allows you to blend the cube images or set up RGB mode
(on any three of them).

<p>
The underlying public access routine, <b>JS9.DisplaySlice()</b>, also
works on FITS 4D data cubes. This plugin will be extended to support
4D cubes if there is a need within the astronomical community.
