<h3>JS9 Image Blinking</h3>

<p>
The <b>Image Blinking</b> plugin allows you repeatedly to display a
sequence of selected images at the specified blink rate. You also can
blink selected images manually.

<p>
The <b>Blink Images</b> option turns on image blinking for all images
that have their own <b>blink</b> option set. (Thus, it is not
necessary to blink all of the loaded images.) The <b>blink rate</b>
menu option allows you to choose the rate of re-display, with values
ranging from 0.1 seconds to 30 seconds. The default is 1 second.  You
also can click the <b>blink manually</b> button to display the next
image in the stack.

<p>
The blink sequence follows the order of the images listed in the image
stack. This order can be changed by moving images up and down the stack.
Note that the currently active image will be displayed with a green
border.  This is the image that responds to contrast/bias changes,
region creation, etc.
