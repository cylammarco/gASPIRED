<h3>Mouse and Touch Actions</h3>

JS9 supports the following configurable mouse and touch actions:
<ul>
<li> mouse movement with no buttons pressed
<li> mouse movement with one button pressed
<li> mouse movement with two buttons pressed
<li> touch with one finger
<li> touch with two fingers
<li> touch with three fingers
</ul>
The initial actions are defined by the <b>JS9.globalOpts.mouseActions</b>
and <b>JS9.globalOpts.touchActions</b> arrays. In addition, the
<b>JS9.globalOpts.mousetouchZoom</b> property specifies whether a mouse wheel
or touch/pinch will zoom the image. The default actions are:
<ul>
<li> <b>mouseActions:</b> ["display value/position", "change contrast/bias", "pan the image"]
<li> <b>touchActions:</b> ["display value/position", "change contrast/bias", "pan the image"]
<li> <b>mousetouchZoom:</b> false
</ul>
where the array elements map to an increasing numbers of
buttons/fingers.  You can change the default actions of the elements
in either array in your js9Prefs.json file. For example, to make pan
and zoom the default one-touch and pinch actions respectively:
<ul>
<li> <b>touchActions:</b> ["pan the image", "display value/position", "change contrast/bias"]
<li> <b>mousetouchZoom:</b> true
</ul>
As usual, the defaults in js9Prefs.json are used by all JS9 displays in
a web page.

<p>
Users can change the action assignments using the <b>MouseTouch</b>
plugin, which displays the current mapping between mouse/touch gesture
and its action. Simply drag and drop an action to a different gesture
in order to change the mapping. You also can toggle the scroll/pinch
to zoom capability by clicking its button.
