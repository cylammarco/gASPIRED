<h3>JS9 Shape Layers</h3>

<p>
JS9 supports individual layers for drawing 2D graphics. The regions
layer is a special case of a shape layer, created automatically by
JS9. The Catalog Plugin creates a separate layer for each catalog.
You can define your own shape layer using the <b>NewShapeLayer()</b>
public routine, and then add geometric shapes to it.

<p>
For a given image, one shape layer at a time is <b>active</b>,
responding to mouse and touch events. Ordinarily, a shape layer
becomes the active layer when it is first created and shapes are
added to it. Thus, the first time you create a region, the regions
layer becomes active. If you then load a catalog into a catalog layer,
that layer becomes active.

<p>
The Shape Layers plugin displays the layers defined for the current
image and allows you to turn on and off the display of any layer.  It
highlights the currently active layer (the topmost visible layer in
the layer stack) allows you to make a layer active by moving it to the
top of the stack.

<p>
You also can save layers to a local file. If the layer is a catalog
(i.e., a tab-delimited table loaded using LoadCatalog() or the load
catalog menu option), you will have the choice of saving the layer
either as a catalog or a region. Otherwise, you will be able to
save the layer as a region.
